# COS730
For Pro Tools legacy system I have developed four components:
The user login component
Editor to Trim audio sound component
Producer to Record sound component
Master Eegineer to convert wav extention audio sound to mp3

I have used the Waterfall software development method to developm my system, 
I made sure each stage of the development was 100% completed before on to the next one. 
First stage is the Requirement Ananlysis; in the first assignment I have identified and analysis all the functional requirements, 
use cases and user stiories that required for the system. Second stage is the System design which was the second assignment,
I identified all the quality requirements needed for the Pro Tools system then I designed the system's Architecture so that it 
meeets the quality requirements identified. I developed my system in units so that I can have each unit tested after the implementation face. 
I gave the system to my colleagues to test it and report issues on my git hub project management so that I can make changes to issue that they find
and 
 when I was done I submitted the prototype assignment.
